# zkSend SDK

<Callout type="warning">
	The zkSend SDK is experimental, and may change before a stable version is released. The features
	described in these docs are only available using the preview version of zkSend, at
	https://preview.zksend.com.
</Callout>

The zkSend SDK provides tools for interacting with the [zkSend website](https://zksend.com). It
allows dApps to integrate zkSend into their applications by providing a standard wallet interface.
It also provides functionality to create your own zkSend Claim Links, with support for any publicly
transferrable asset.

## Installation

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/zksend
```

<Callout type="info">
	During the development of the zkSend SDK, you may want to install the experimental version.

```sh npm2yarn
npm i @mysten/zksend@experimental @mysten/sui.js@experimental
# If you use dapp-kit, you'll also need the experimental version:

```
