## Asset Tokenization

Asset tokenization refers to the process of representing real-world assets, such as real estate, art, commodities, stocks, or other valuable assets, as digital tokens on the blockchain network. This involves converting the ownership or rights of an asset into digital tokens, which are then recorded and managed on the blockchain. See [Asset Tokenization](./advanced/asset-tokenization.mdx) to learn more.
